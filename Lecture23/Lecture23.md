## Feature Engineering

- Feature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge to create features from data, which will make machine learning algorithms work better.
- The classifications of feature engineering are:
  - Feature Construction: Creating new features from existing data.
  - Feature Transformation: Modifying existing features to improve their performance.
  - Feature Selection: Selecting the most relevant features for the model.
  - Feature Extraction: Extracting features from raw data using techniques like PCA or autoencoders.
- Important steps in Feature Transformation include:
  - Missing values imputation
  - Encoding categorical variables
  - Outlier detection
  - Feature Scaling
- Feature Construction is mostly based on the intuition of the data scientist and domain knowledge.
- Feature Extraction is often used in high-dimensional data to reduce the number of features while retaining important information.
