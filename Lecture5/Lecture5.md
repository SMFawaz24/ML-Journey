## Online ML

- Data is being fed sequentially to the ML model for better training.
- Model is improved after every training.
- Can also be trained while being deployed online on the server.
- Alexa, Siri are famous examples.
- Advantages:
  1. Cost effective
  2. Can be used when concept drifts
  3. Faster solution
- Learning Rate is the frequency at which the model is being trained at.
- Disadvantages:
  1. Tricky to use
  2. Risky
  3. Constantly monitor the system
