## Batch ML

- Conventional way of training an ML model.
- Uses the entire dataset for training.
- Scientists train the model in an offline mode on their own systems.
- No updates can be made to the ML model as it is static.
- Model has to undergo training periodically.
- Disadvantages:
  1. Huge Data Load
  2. Hardware Limitation
  3. Availability
