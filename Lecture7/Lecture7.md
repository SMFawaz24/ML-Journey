## Challenges in ML

- Data collection is tough on a higher level as gathering data from API or web scraping is risky.
- Even if data is collected, it might be insufficient for training the model.
- Data labelling is a very tedious task.
- Poor representation of data can take place due to sampling noise/bias.
- Poor quality of data results in poor results in ML models.
- Irrelevant features can also lead to poor performance of models.
  <br>
- **Overfitting** &rarr; Models memorize particular data patterns because of which they don't provide good results when new data is added.
  <br>
- **Underfitting** &rarr; Models use too simple calculations on data patterns that often leads to poor performance.
  <br>
- Integrating ML into the software is very challenging than expected.
- Offline Learning is hard to implement on a regular basis and deployment of ML softwares is also costly.
- ML models require high cost to deploy them on a server, as it is not optimised, which is again a big ask.
