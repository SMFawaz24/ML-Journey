## Instance-based Learning

- Stores the data and only acts when needed.
- Prediction is based on the similarities.
- Requires heavy storage.

## Model-based Learning

- Reads the data and creates a mathematical relation between the inputs.
- Learns and receives new information by training itself frequently.
- Has fixed parameters to predict the output from the data.
- Very light storage is required.
